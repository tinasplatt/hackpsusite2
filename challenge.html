	<h1>Hack Harassment</h1>
	<p>Online harassment has become a pervasive and often vicious problem with real-life repercussions. Today's tech and media leaders have a collective responsibility and capability to identify solutions that can help reduce the incidence and intensity of online harassment and provide a platform for the industry and those who care about fighting harassment to come together in support of a safer, more inclusive, smart and connected online world.  Together we can #HackHarassment and are here today to ask for your help.</p>
	<p>We need to better diagnose what Online Harassment looks like in its many forms.  To make measurable improvements in reducing harassment, we need to build a better set of data for what harassment looks like as it exists today and in the future.  Like good engineers we like to quantify, measure, experiment, and test to improve and that means starting with understanding what online harassment looks like across all of our online interactions.</p>
	<p>Help create a solution that will allow us to capture social interactions, identify and tag if it's harassment.  You can start from existing available data sources and APIs, but a solution must be scalable across many online applications and can be tested to identify Harassment or not through unique and innovative algorithms.</p>

	<h1>National Instruments - Labview Challenge</h1>
	<p>Prompt:  Incorporate LabVIEW in your project!  Use LabVIEW in pursuit of any challenge and be entered to win an additional prize from National Instruments (see prize details below).  Winning entries will use LabVIEW more extensively, creatively, and effectively!  Feel free to utilize existing libraries and examples, but end result must be considered original work.</p>

	<p>Higher esteem for using LabVIEW to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>interface with hardware/peripherals (ex: myDAQ, arduino, game controllers, other NI hardware, etc)</li>
	    <li>connect multiple devices (ex: TCP, bluetooth, etc)</li>
	    <li>call external code/libraries (or call LV from external code!)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Prize details (for each member of winning team):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>LabVIEW Physical Computing Kit with chipKIT WF32</li>
	        <ul>
	        	<li>LabVIEW Home Edition</li>
	            <li>chipKIT WF32</li>
